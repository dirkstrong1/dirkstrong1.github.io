            <div class="subheading mb-3">Determining housing prices by discovering the key contributing factors.</div>
            <p>
                Our approach to this model was to discover key variables that can help accurately 
                determine sale price of a home in King County.
                Our first task was to see what sorts of questions we could answer to solve 
                business problems with data that was present in the raw data. 
                Secondly, we cleaned the data, eliminated any features that did 
                not help solve our business propositions and add any that gave better insight into what factors affect price. 
                Once we had our initial model we tweaked features to fit our model 
                to our split training data and test on the test data for more accurate 
                predictions. Our end goal was to minimize error as much as possible, provide 
                insights on what affects price, and develop a strategy around solving business 
                questions posed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our model, though not perfect, helps show the various factors that can affect 
                house price in King County. Our root mean square error on that price is just
                over $130k for both the linear regression and through the lasso function meaning we
                can expect a variance in price to that amount when predicting a sale price for a home.
                By using data that takes into account data that spans more years, has more data from
                the more rural zipcodes for King County, and/or potentially grouping zipcodes into bins
                to help see the price based on an area versus arbitrary zipcodes may help make the model
                better. Our presentation mentions some next steps we would take given the time and tools
                to help improve the model but feel through our current iteration we could certainly make 
                some business decisions based on our findings.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Investigating real estate investment markets using time series analysis.</div>
            <p>
                This project was an effort to use historical Zillow housing data
                from zipcodes across the US to analyze markets and their market
                potential for investment. Using Facebook Prophet to predict the 
                ROI range after five years for all the zipcodes in the data set,
                we then gave our top five zipcodes for highest potential ROI,
                expected potential ROI, and lowest risk ROI based on the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our model found several unexpected results but, after
                cross referencing with actual current data, was making reasonable
                decisions based on all the sales data of hundereds of thousands
                of US entries. Understanding our business problem of suggesting
                markets to banks or property investors we categorized to help 
                offer a varied portfolio of properties to ensure recouped investment.
